# This workflow is a part of release automation process.
# It is intended to be run with workflow_dispatch event by the automation.

# Warning: Workflow does switch branches and this may lead to confusion when changing workflow actions.
# The usual safety rule is to make changes to workflow or actions in base branch (e.g, release/8.X)
# Version branches (e.g, 8.0.10-rc5-int8) will merge changes from base branch automatically.
